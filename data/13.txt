Acknowledge and endorse resale documents
----------------------------------------

You and the sellers must endorse the documents before HDB may approve the resale application.

Arrow down icon](#Acknowledgeandendorseresaledocuments-1)

We will prepare the necessary documents for you and the sellers to endorse, which will be ready about 3 weeks after the application have been accepted.

Once the documents are ready, they will be posted on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard), and we will notify you and the sellers via SMS to log in to My Flat DashboardÂ to endorse the documents.

If you or the sellers do not endorse the documents within the given timeframe, the resale application may be cancelled.

If you appoint HDB as the solicitors for the purchase of the flat, the documents to endorse include:

**Buyerâ€™s financial plan**

A proposed financial plan based on what you have stated in your resale application.

If you wish to make changes to the draft financial plan, please revise and endorse the financial plan in My Flat Dashboard.

**CPF withdrawal**

The CPF withdrawal based on the endorsed financial plan.

Please ensure that all the buyers have sufficient savings in the CPF Ordinary Accounts for the payment. If there are insufficient funds in the CPF accounts at the point of the deduction, you have to pay any shortfall in cash.

**Health declaration for CPF Boardâ€™s Home Protection Scheme**

If you are taking an HDB housing loan and/ or using your CPF savings to pay for the flat purchase, you must fill up a Health Declaration form to declare your share of the insurance coverage and health status, for the CPF Boardâ€™s Home Protection Scheme (HPS).

**Resale documents**

You must endorse all the undertakings and forms posted on My Flat Dashboard.

If you have applied for the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) ([Families](/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/proximity-housing-grant-families) or [Singles](/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/singles/proximity-housing-grant-singles)), your parents or child will also need to endorse the undertakings on My Flat Dashboard. They will need to log in the dashboard via their Singpass.

If you appoint your own solicitors for the purchase of the flat, the documents that you will endorse may be different from the above.

##### Important note:

*   The resale documents must be endorsed individually by all the buyers. Read through the documents before endorsing them. The documents are in PDF format and you may save a copy for reference
*   You can check the status of the endorsement process via My Flat Dashboard

Stamp duty
----------

The stamp duty is payable by CPF savings. If you wish to use cash instead of your CPF savings, please contact us using ourÂ [e-Feedback form](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF12AWFeedback/BF12SFrontController?service=ServiceFeedback&operation=createFeedback) with your request after your resale application is accepted. If you do not have enough CPF savings to pay the stamp duty in full, or you are not taking any housing loan but engaging HDB to act for you in the purchase, you must pay the stamp fees during your resale completion appointment by cashier's order and/ or NETS.

You must make the initial payment of the purchase price after you have endorsed the resale documents, by the deadline given by HDB, if you are taking a housing loan from HDB or financial institution (FI).

The balance purchase price must be paid on or before theÂ [resale completion](/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-completion).
