You should also check the upgrading costs (if applicable) for your converted flat.

Mode of financing
-----------------

#### Purchase of 2 adjoining flats

If you are buying 2 adjoining flats, which will be converted into 1 unit, you may obtain a housing loan\* for the purchase of both flats.

\* The application of a housing loan from HDB or financial institutions will be subjected to eligibility conditions and credit assessments

#### Purchase of flat adjoining your current unit

If you are buying a flat adjoining your current flat and have an outstanding housing loan, that loan must first be discharged.

The financing of the adjoining flat is as follows:



* If the adjoining flat is to be financed with:: A housing loan from a financial institution (FI)
  * Details:                             Check with the FI on the new loan amount, which will comprise the outstanding housing loan amount for your current flat and the amount required to buy the adjoining flat                Ensure that the outstanding housing loan from HDB/ FI for your current flat has been discharged before you buy the adjoining flat                        
* If the adjoining flat is to be financed with:: A housing loan from HDB and the current flat is financed with a housing loan from a FI
  * Details:                             The housing loan from HDB will only be for the amount needed to buy the adjoining flat                Ensure that you have enough funds to discharge the outstanding loan for your current flat, and do so before you buy the adjoining flat                        


Physically converting 2 flats into 1 unit
-----------------------------------------

Upon completing the purchase of the adjoining flat(s), the adjoining flats must be converted into a single unit by:

*   Engaging a renovation contractor from the [Directory of Renovation Contractors](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BN31AWERRCMobile/BN31PListingContractor.jsp) to construct at least 1 opening of at least 1 metre by 2 metres between the 2 units
*   Engaging a licensed contractor to remove the PUB meters (electricity, water, and gas supply) for 1 of the 2 units

You may retain your current unit number for the converted flat.
