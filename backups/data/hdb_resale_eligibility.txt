\* For example, if the private residential property was disposed of on 1 January 2024, based on the legal completion date of disposal, you may apply for an HFE letter to buy a non-subsidised resale flat without an HDB housing loan on or after 1 April 2025. To apply for an HFE letter to buy a subsidised flat, or take an HDB concessionary housing loan, please do so on or after 1 July 2026.  

Singapore citizens (and their spouses) aged 55 and above who own or have an interest in a private residential property may buy a flat and do not need to meet the time period requirement in the above table if they intend to buy any of the following:

*   4-room or smaller non-subsidised resale flat without an HDB housing loan. They may apply for the Proximity Housing Grant, if eligible.

These seniors must dispose of their interest in the private residential property, based on the legal completion of the disposal, within 6 months of the completion of the flat purchase.

#### Non-residential property

All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application can, as a household, own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property^ at the point of applying for an HFE letter, if they wish to buy a flat from HDB, a resale flat with CPF housing grants, or a resale Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flat.

^ This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.

If the applicants and occupiers own or have an interest in more than 1 non-residential property, they must have disposed of the other non-residential properties at least 30 months (counted from the legal completion date of the disposal of the interest) before applying for an HFE letter.

*   Non-subsidised resale flat (excluding resale PLH flat) without an HDB housing loan. They may apply for the Proximity Housing Grant, if eligible.

These seniors can continue to own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property after the flat purchase. They must dispose of the other non-residential properties, based on the legal completion of the disposal, within 6 months of the completion of the flat purchase.

**Previous housing subsidies**

A subsidised housing unit refers to:

*   A flat bought from HDB
*   A resale flat bought on the open market with CPF housing grant
*   A Design Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat bought from a property developer
*   An EC unit bought from a property developer
*   Other forms of housing subsidy (e.g., enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), privatisation of HUDC estate, etc.)

Any previous housing subsidy taken does not affect the eligibility to buy a resale flat.

**Note:**

The number of housing subsidies you have taken will affect your eligibility to apply for CPF housing grants (excluding Proximity Housing Grant).

**Resale levy payable**

If you and/ or any [core member(s)](#fs-core) have taken a housing subsidy, you are considered a second-timer. All second-timer core member(s) will need to pay their respective resale levies\[3\], if applicable, when buying a flat from HDB. Find out more on the [resale levy payable](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=resale-levy).

If you and/ or any core members have taken 2 housing subsidies, you are not eligible to apply or be listed as a core occupier in a flat application to buy a flat from HDB\[4\] or resale PLH flat on the open market.

\[3\] Resale levy is not applicable to buyers of resale PLH flats.  
\[4\] Seniors may apply for a short-lease flat. Read [seniors](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/seniors) for more information.

Not applicable **Ownership/ interest in HDB flat**

If you or any person listed in the application owns or has an interest in any HDB flat, you must dispose of the interest in the flat, within 6 months of completing your flat purchase. This shall be based on the legal completion date of the disposal.

**Undischarged bankrupt**

If you are an undischarged bankrupt, prior consent must be obtained from the Official Assignee (OA) or the private trustee, to apply to buy:

*   An HDB flat that is bigger than a 5-room flat or a 3Gen flat
*   Any flat type with a net purchase price of $500,000 or above, after taking into account any HDB subsidies or levy

You do not need to seek prior consent from the OA or the private trustee if you are listed as an occupier of a flat.

**CPF housing grants**

Eligible families may apply for the following CPF housing grants for their flat purchase:

*   [Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (Families)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/enhanced-cpf-housing-grant-families)

A subsidised housing unit refers to:

*   A flat bought from HDB
*   A resale flat bought on the open market with CPF housing grant
*   A Design Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat bought from a property developer
*   An EC unit bought from a property developer
*   Other forms of housing subsidy (e.g., enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), privatisation of HUDC estate, etc.)

Any previous housing subsidy taken does not affect the eligibility to buy a resale flat.

**Note:**

The number of housing subsidies you have taken will affect your eligibility to apply for CPF housing grants (excluding Proximity Housing Grant).

**Resale levy payable**

If you and/ or any [core member(s)](#pa-core) have taken a housing subsidy, you are considered a second-timer. All second-timer core member(s) will need to pay their respective resale levies\[3\], if applicable, when buying a flat from HDB.

*   An HDB flat that is bigger than a 5-room flat or a 3Gen flat
*   Any flat type with a net purchase price of $500,000 or above, after taking into account any HDB subsidies or levy

**Previous housing subsidies**

A subsidised housing unit refers to:

*   A flat bought from HDB
*   A resale flat bought on the open market with CPF housing grant
*   A Design Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat bought from a property developer
*   An EC unit bought from a property developer
*   Other forms of housing subsidy (e.g., enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), privatisation of HUDC estate, etc.)

Any previous housing subsidy taken does not affect the eligibility to buy a resale flat.

**Note:**

The number of housing subsidies you have taken will affect your eligibility to apply for CPF housing grants (excluding Proximity Housing Grant).

**Resale levy payable**

If you and/ or any [core member(s)](#or-core) have taken a housing subsidy, you are considered a second-timer. All second-timer core member(s) will need to pay their respective resale levies\[3\], if applicable, when buying a flat from HDB. Find out more on the [resale levy payable](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=resale-levy).

If you and/ or any core members have taken 2 housing subsidies, you are not eligible to apply or be listed as a core occupier in a flat application to buy a flat from HDB\[4\] or resale PLH flat on the open market.

\[3\] Resale levy is not applicable to buyers of resale PLH flats.  
\[4\] Seniors may apply for a short-lease flat. Read [seniors](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/seniors) for more information.

If you or any person listed in the application owns or has an interest in any HDB flat, you must dispose of the interest in the flat, within 6 months of completing your flat purchase. This shall be based on the legal completion date of the disposal.

**Undischarged bankrupt**

If you are an undischarged bankrupt, prior consent must be obtained from the Official Assignee (OA) or the private trustee, if:

*   You are applying to buy an HDB flat that is bigger than a 5-room flat or a 3Gen flat
*   You are buying any flat type with a net purchase price of $500,000 or above, after taking into account any HDB subsidies or levy

You do not need to seek prior consent from the OA or the private trustee if you are listed as an occupier of a flat.

*   Must not own or have an interest in any local or overseas private property; and
*   Must not have disposed of any private property in the last 30 months, from the legal completion date\*, before the HFE letter application.

#### Non-residential property

All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application can, as a household, own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property^ at the point of applying for an HFE letter, if they wish to buy a flat from HDB, a resale flat with CPF housing grants, or a resale Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flat.

^ This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.

If the applicants and occupiers own or have an interest in more than 1 non-residential property, they must have disposed of the other non-residential properties at least 30 months (counted from the legal completion date of the disposal of the interest) before applying for an HFE letter.

**Amount**

The amount is based on the average gross monthly household income assessed over the months worked during the 12-month period, which ends 2 months preceding the month of the HFE letter application. The incomes of all working persons in the household (all applicants and occupiers) are included in the assessment. Households with lower household incomes will receive a bigger grant amount.

To apply for an HFE letter to buy a subsidised flat, or take an HDB concessionary housing loan, please do so on or after 1 July 2026.  

Singapore citizens (and their spouses) aged 55 and above who own or have an interest in a private residential property may buy a flat and do not need to meet the time period requirement in the above table if they intend to buy any of the following:

^ This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.

If the applicants and occupiers own or have an interest in more than 1 non-residential property, they must have disposed of the other non-residential properties at least 30 months (counted from the legal completion date of the disposal of the interest) before applying for an HFE letter.

**Previous housing subsidies**

Only first-timer [core applicants](#ssc-core) may qualify.

*   An EC unit bought from a property developer
*   Other forms of housing subsidy (e.g., enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), privatisation of HUDC estate, etc.)

Any previous housing subsidy taken does not affect the eligibility to buy a resale flat.

**Note:**

If you have taken any housing subsidies, you are not eligible to apply for CPF housing grants (excluding Proximity Housing Grant).

**Ownership/ interest in HDB flat** If you or any person listed in the application owns or has an interest in any HDB flat, you must dispose of the interest in the flat, within 6 months of completing your flat purchase.

#### Non-residential property

All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application can, as a household, own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property^ at the point of applying for an HFE letter, if they wish to buy a flat from HDB, a resale flat with CPF housing grants, or a resale Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flat.

^ This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.

If the applicants and occupiers own or have an interest in more than 1 non-residential property, they must have disposed of the other non-residential properties at least 30 months (counted from the legal completion date of the disposal of the interest) before applying for an HFE letter.

These seniors can continue to own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property after the flat purchase. They must dispose of the other non-residential properties, based on the legal completion of the disposal, within 6 months of the completion of the flat purchase.

**Previous housing subsidies**

Only first-timer [core applicants](#jss-core) may qualify.

If you and/ or your core applicants have taken a housing subsidy, you are a second-timer and will not be eligible for another housing subsidy. A subsidised housing unit refers to:

*   A flat bought from HDB
*   A resale flat bought on the open market with CPF housing grant
*   A Design Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat bought from a property developer
*   An EC unit bought from a property developer
*   Other forms of housing subsidy (e.g. enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), privatisation of HUDC estate, etc.)

Any previous housing subsidy taken does not affect the eligibility to buy a resale flat.

**Note:**

If you have taken any housing subsidies, you are not eligible to apply for CPF housing grants (excluding Proximity Housing Grant).

**Ownership/ interest in HDB flat** If you or any person listed in the application owns or has an interest in any HDB flat, you must dispose of the interest in the flat, within 6 months of completing your flat purchase.
