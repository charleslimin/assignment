# HDB | Overview
Here is an overview of the resale process:

[![Buying and Selling - Aug 2024](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/EAPG/EAPG-CSC/Buying-and-Selling---Aug-2024.ashx?h=106%25&w=100%25&hash=E4046AA94C6B98937E120C122DF8F4FF)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/EAPG/EAPG-CSC/Buying-and-Selling---Aug-2024.ashx)

Buying a resale flat
--------------------

Log in to [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) on [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing) to start your journey. You will be guided through the following steps for the buying process:

[![Buying a resale flat - Aug 2024](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/EAPG/EAPG-CSC/Buying-a-resale-flat---Aug-2024.ashx?h=121%25&w=100%25&hash=8456617DFF2FB24280210A0AE81A0044)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/EAPG/EAPG-CSC/Buying-a-resale-flat---Aug-2024.ashx)

#### Step 1 and 2: Obtain an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) Letter

Apply for an [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. The HFE letter will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/hdb-flat-portal/HFE/get-help) on the HFE letter.

You may request for an In-Principle Approval from the participating financial institutions when you apply for an HFE letter. 

#### Step 3: Search for a suitable flat and obtain an Option to Purchase (OTP) from flat seller

After obtaining an HFE letter, you may look for a suitable flat that meets your budget and household needs.

Browse resale flat listings on the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/finding-a-flat). Read our guide on [finding a flat](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat?anchor=resale-flat) for more information on the Resale Flat Listing (RFL) service and other resources you can use to help plan and prepare for your flat purchase.

You can either manage the purchase on your own or engage the service of a salesperson for a fee. Please read [managing the flat purchase](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/planning-considerations/managing-the-flat-purchase) and consider signing up for our [resale seminars](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat/resale-seminars) to learn more about resale policies and procedures.

Obtain an [Option to Purchase (OTP)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/option-to-purchase) from the flat seller\* after you have agreed on the flat price.

\* Sellers must have registered an Intent to Sell for more than 7 days.

#### Step 4: Confirm mode of financing

If you intend to get an [HDB housing loan](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-hdb), you will need a valid HFE letter^ from HDB before flat sellers may grant you an OTP.

If you have indicated that you intend to get an HDB housing loan in your HFE application, the loan outcome will be reflected in your HFE letter accordingly.

If you have indicated that you intend to get a [housing loan from a financial institution](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-financial-institutions) in your HFE application, you must have a valid Letter of Offer (LO) before you exercise the OTP. You may concurrently request an In-Principle Approval and LO from participating financial institutions when applying for the HFE letter^ on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard).

^ Refer to Steps 1 and 2 to determine if you need a valid HFE letter.

#### Step 5: Submit Request for Value

If you are paying for the flat purchase with CPF savings and/ or housing loan, submit a [Request for Value](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/request-for-value) by the next working day after you get the OTP.

This is not required if you are not using your CPF savings and any housing loan to pay for the flat purchase.

#### Step 6: Convert In-Principle Approval (IPA) into a Letter of Offer (LO)

If you have requested for an IPA while applying for the HFE letter, you can convert the IPA into an LO at this step, before exercising the OTP during the Option Period.

#### Step 7: Submit resale application

After you exercise the OTP, you and the sellers must submit the respective portions of the [resale application](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application).

#### Step 8 and 9: Acknowledge resale documents and pay fees

Upon receiving a complete resale application and the full set of supporting documents from you and the sellers, we will verify the eligibility of both parties and accept the resale application within 28 working days. We will prepare the necessary documents for you and the sellers to endorse, which will be ready about 3 weeks after the application has been accepted. You and the sellers must acknowledge and [endorse the resale documents](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/acceptance-and-approval?anchor=endorse), and [pay the necessary fees](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/acceptance-and-approval?anchor=legal-fees-initial-payment).

#### Step 10: Get resale approval

After the documents are endorsed and fees paid, HDB will grant an [approval](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/acceptance-and-approval?anchor=approval) for the resale transaction.

#### Step 11: Attend completion appointment

[Resale completion](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-completion) is about 8 weeks from the date of HDB’s acceptance of the resale application. This is the earliest possible date to complete the transaction. If you wish to defer the completion, please discuss with your sellers and let us have a written confirmation (signed by both sellers and buyers) via [MyRequest@HDB](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BE15AWMyRequest/BE15PMain). You and the sellers will be notified via SMS of the appointment. You may also log in to [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) for the appointment details.

# HDB | Managing the Flat Purchase
You can either manage the flat purchase on your own or engage the services of a salesperson for a fee.

Manage the purchase on your own
-------------------------------

The following guide will prepare you for the flat purchase.

[

Check your eligibility to buy a resale flat
-------------------------------------------

You must have a valid HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter before you can obtain an Option to Purchase (OTP) from a flat seller.

](#Checkyoureligibilitytobuyaresaleflat-1)

Start your journey by applying for an [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) via [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. The HFE letter will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/hdb-flat-portal/HFE/get-help) on the HFE letter.

If you intend to get a [housing loan from a financial institution](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-financial-institutions), you must have a valid Letter of Offer (LO) before you exercise the OTP. You may request for an In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the participating financial institutions when you apply for an HFE letter and request to convert the IPA to LO via [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard).

[

Consider your budget
--------------------

Plan your finances and work out your budget before you search for a suitable flat.

](#Consideryourbudget-2)

You may use a combination of cash, savings in your CPF Ordinary Account, and a [housing loan from HDB](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-hdb) or a [financial institution (FI)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-financial-institutions) regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to buy a flat.

To plan for your flat purchase, you may use the [budget calculator](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator/budget) to estimate your budget and compare the information on housing loans offered by HDB and our participating FIs.

Learn more about the [mode of financing](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/mode-of-financing) for your flat, where we provide a breakdown of the payments required, and the types of housing loans available and financial tools you can use.

Make sure you set aside some cash savings for renovation and other necessary expenses to settle into your new home.

[

Search for a flat
-----------------

Search for a resale flat using HDB’s Resale Flat Listing (RFL) service or through other reputable platforms.

](#Searchforaflat-3)

After you have obtained an HFE letter (as well as an In-principle Approval letter for a housing loan from the financial institutions, if applicable) and worked out your budget, you may browse resale flat listings on the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/finding-a-flat). Read our guide on [finding a flat](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat?anchor=resale-flat) for more information on the Resale Flat Listing (RFL) service and other resources you can use to help you plan and prepare for your flat purchase.

You may also refer to property portals, newspaper advertisements or social media section in your search for a flat.

*   [Your budget](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator/budget)
*   Your housing needs, e.g. to live near parents’ or child’s home, place of work, schools, etc.
*   Your ethnic group to buy a flat in the block, or your nationality if you are a Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) household. Learn more about the [Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) and SPR quota](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/planning-considerations/eip-spr-quota)
*   Remaining lease of the flat\*

You may be approached by salespersons offering to act for you. If you are handling the purchase on your own, please tell them so.

\* CPF usage and HDB housing loan limits will depend on the extent the remaining lease can cover the youngest buyer to the age of 95. You can check the maximum amount of CPF savings and loan that can be used for housing by using [CPF Board's e-service](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tools-and-services/calculators/cpf-housing-usage) and HDB housing loan using our [payment plan calculator](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator/payment-plan).

[

Attend flat viewings
--------------------

When you attend a flat viewing appointment, these are some considerations to keep in mind.

](#Attendflatviewings-4)

If you have a valid HFE letter, you may arrange flat viewing appointments with flat sellers or their appointed salesperson(s) in the resale flat listings on the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/finding-a-flat). Refer to our [user guide](https://go.gov.sg/hdb-rfl-buyer-guide) and [instructional video](https://go.gov.sg/hdb-rfl-buyer-video) for more details on how to do so.

You may arrange for viewings at different times of the day and week to better gauge if a flat is suitable for you. During a viewing, do consider the following:

*   Condition of the flat, e.g. renovation and upkeep
*   Spalling concrete, cracks, or leakages on ceiling or wall
*   Flat orientation, e.g. north, south, east, or west
*   Any tenants in the flat and whether they can move out by the resale completion date
*   Signs of moneylending activities from, e.g. loan-sharks
*   If the flat is on a lift-landing floor
*   Any upgrading programmes announced for the flat, and if the upgrading cost has been paid
*   Issues which you may be concerned with, e.g. past incidents which may have happened in the flat, neighbours, environment, etc.

If you have any doubts, clarify with the flat sellers or their salesperson. Take note of the answers and observe their reactions.

#### Proof of flat ownership

Request the flat sellers to show proof that they own the flat and are eligible to sell it.

Documents such as a printout from the flat sellers’ [My HDBPage](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/FI10PPORTAL/FI10PAtAGlance.jsp) at HDB InfoWEB, property tax statement, town council statement, or title deed are examples of documents that can confirm the owners of a flat.

[

Negotiate the price
-------------------

Price negotiation is not simply about offering the lowest price and haggling with flat sellers. Here are some useful tips.

](#Negotiatetheprice-5)

#### Prepare yourself

Be mindful of your budget, which you must consider before starting your search for a flat. Make a reasonable offer, based on your budget and your perceived value of the flat.

#### Arm yourself with information and alternatives

You are in a better position to negotiate when you have:

*   More information about the flat, such as the flat type, remaining lease, and recent transacted prices of similar flats nearby
*   Found other flats which you are open to consider buying

#### Time and timing

Do not rush into your flat purchase. Give yourself time to look around and assess your choices.

When you see a flat that suits your budget and needs, take your time to inspect the flat and its condition before deciding on the purchase.

#### Other matters

Other than the flat price, there are other matters you must consider when you negotiate with the flat sellers:



* Deposit            comprising Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee            : Option Fee
  *             You must pay flat sellers an Option Fee when they grant you an Option to Purchase (OTP), and an Option Exercise Fee when you exercise the OTP.            You may negotiate the amounts of Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee with the flat sellers, which will form part of the resale price.                                                                        Payment by flat buyers to sellers: Granting of OTP
  * Stage of OTP: Between $1 and $1,000
  * Amount to pay: 
* Deposit            comprising Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee            : Option Exercise Fee
  *             You must pay flat sellers an Option Fee when they grant you an Option to Purchase (OTP), and an Option Exercise Fee when you exercise the OTP.            You may negotiate the amounts of Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee with the flat sellers, which will form part of the resale price.                                                                        Payment by flat buyers to sellers: Exercising of OTP
  * Stage of OTP: An amount, which when including the Option Fee, will not exceed $5,000
  * Amount to pay: 


You are encouraged to make payment using digital payment modes to secure independent proof of payment.

**Submission of resale application**

Under Clause 12 of the OTP, you and the sellers must agree on the timeframe to [submit the resale application](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application) to HDB.

This is a contractual term between you and the sellers. Once it is agreed upon, it may be varied only with mutual consent.

Please submit the resale application as soon as possible to minimise unforeseeable changes, e.g. EIP and SPR quotas, untoward events, etc.

**Extension of stay**

To ease sellers’ transition to their next home, sellers may arrange with you to extend their stay temporarily in the flat, for up to 3 months after the resale completion.

The [temporary extension of stay](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/selling-a-flat/resale-application/request-for-temporary-extension-of-stay) is subject to your agreement. If you agree, the minimum occupation period that you have to fulfil after the flat purchase will start only when the sellers have moved out of your flat.

**Enhanced Contra Facility**

If you are planning to sell your existing HDB flat and buy another resale HDB flat, you may consider applying for the [Enhanced Contra Facility (ECF)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/request-for-enhanced-contra-facility). This facility allows you to use the cash proceeds and refunded CPF savings from the flat sale and complete the purchase of your next flat at the same time.

Take note that if you are applying for the ECF when buying your next flat, the buyers of your existing flat and the flat sellers of your intended resale flat purchase will not be able to apply for ECF for their respective flat purchases.

**Any other matters** For example, will the sellers leave behind any furniture or appliances? They may offer these items to you and include the items in the inventory list of the OTP.

](#UnderstandtheHDBresaleprocedures-6)

Engage a salesperson
--------------------

You may engage a salesperson for a fee to help you manage the flat purchase. Nevertheless, you still need to know your eligibility to buy a resale flat and the financing of the flat purchase. You may read the information in ‘Manage the purchase on your own’, and also:

*   Read the Council for Estate Agents (CEA)'s [Consumer Guide](https://www.cea.gov.sg/4steps) and [educational materials](https://www.cea.gov.sg/consumers/educational-materials/guides-brochures) for practical tips when engaging the services of a salesperson
*   Check the salesperson’s phone number with [CEA's Public Register](https://www.cea.gov.sg/public-register) to verify his/her identity and ensure he/she is a registered salesperson, and safeguard yourself against scammers.
*   Consider using the CEA’s [Prescribed Estate Agency Agreement](https://www.cea.gov.sg/professionals/agreements_and_checklists) when engaging the salesperson’s services
*   Ensure that you discuss with the salesperson and mutually agree on:
    *   The terms of service
    *   The commission payable
    *   The period of representation
    *   Any exclusivity (if agreed upon)
    *   Any other terms, such as payment for advertising

Engaging a salesperson is a private matter between you and the salesperson. If you have any issues relating to estate agents or their salespersons, please seek clarification from CEA.

# HDB | Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) and Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) Quota 
When buying an HDB resale flat, you must ensure your household is within the EIP quota for the block and neighbourhood, and if applicable, the SPR quota as well.

How the EIP and SPR quota work
------------------------------

The EIP quota applies for the purchase of an HDB flat. In addition, non-Malaysian SPR households must meet the SPR quota.

You may be eligible to buy a flat if:

*   You and the flat seller are of the same ethnic group and household citizenship; or
*   After your flat purchase, the number of households of your ethnic group remains within the block and neighbourhood limits. In addition, for non-Malaysian SPR households, the number of SPR households remains within the SPR quota.

Check your eligibility
----------------------

You may use our [e-Service](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB29ETHN/BB29STREET) to check if you are eligible to buy an HDB resale flat in a particular block or neighbourhood under the EIP/ SPR quota. The prevailing EIP and SPR quotas for the month are also displayed on the resale flat listings on the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/finding-a-flat). The quotas are updated on the 1st of each month.

Please check to ensure compliance with the EIP/ SPR quota at each of the following milestones:

*   Flat sellers grant the Option to Purchase (OTP);
*   You exercise the OTP; and
*   You and the flat sellers submit the respective portion of the resale application.

\* A resale application is completed only when HDB receives both the buyers’ and sellers’ portions of the resale application and the necessary supporting documents.

About the EIP
-------------

The EIP is put in place to preserve Singapore’s multi-cultural identity and promote racial integration and harmony. It ensures that there is a balanced mix of the various ethnic communities in HDB towns. The EIP limits are set at block and neighbourhood levels based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore.

For the purchase of an HDB flat, a household with members of different ethnic groups may choose to classify their household ethnicity under the ethnicity of any buyer(s) or spouse according to the race shown on their NRIC.

Once an ethnicity is chosen for the household, it will remain the same when the flat owners subsequently sell their flat on the open market.

About the SPR quota
-------------------

The SPR quota ensures that SPR families can better integrate into the local community. Malaysians are excluded from this quota because of their close cultural and historical similarities with Singaporeans. Non-Malaysian SPR households applying to buy an HDB resale flat need to be within the SPR quota for the block (8%) and neighbourhood (5%).

# HDB | Conversion Scheme Application Procedure
If you and your family intend to buy adjoining flats that are 3-room or smaller and convert them into 1 unit under the Conversion Scheme, you have to meet the eligibility conditions and adhere to the conditions after purchasing the converted flat. You should also check the upgrading costs (if applicable) for your converted flat.

Eligibility conditions
----------------------

Your family is formed by a [married couple, and/ or parent(s) and child(ren)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families?anchor=pa).

**Note:**

Confirm if pairing of flats is possible
---------------------------------------

We will assess the flats and inform you whether pairing the flats is possible. If so, you may then proceed with the purchase.

Mode of financing
-----------------

#### Purchase of 2 adjoining flats

If you are buying 2 adjoining flats, which will be converted into 1 unit, you may obtain a housing loan\* for the purchase of both flats.

\* The application of a housing loan from HDB or financial institutions will be subjected to eligibility conditions and credit assessments

#### Purchase of flat adjoining your current unit

If you are buying a flat adjoining your current flat and have an outstanding housing loan, that loan must first be discharged.

The financing of the adjoining flat is as follows:



* If the adjoining flat is to be financed with:: A housing loan from a financial institution (FI)
  * Details:                             Check with the FI on the new loan amount, which will comprise the outstanding housing loan amount for your current flat and the amount required to buy the adjoining flat                Ensure that the outstanding housing loan from HDB/ FI for your current flat has been discharged before you buy the adjoining flat                        
* If the adjoining flat is to be financed with:: A housing loan from HDB and the current flat is financed with a housing loan from a FI
  * Details:                             The housing loan from HDB will only be for the amount needed to buy the adjoining flat                Ensure that you have enough funds to discharge the outstanding loan for your current flat, and do so before you buy the adjoining flat                        


Physically converting 2 flats into 1 unit
-----------------------------------------

Upon completing the purchase of the adjoining flat(s), the adjoining flats must be converted into a single unit by:

*   Engaging a renovation contractor from the [Directory of Renovation Contractors](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BN31AWERRCMobile/BN31PListingContractor.jsp) to construct at least 1 opening of at least 1 metre by 2 metres between the 2 units
*   Engaging a licensed contractor to remove the PUB meters (electricity, water, and gas supply) for 1 of the 2 units

You may retain your current unit number for the converted flat.

Conditions after buying the converted flat
------------------------------------------

#### Minimum occupation period (MOP)

You may sell the converted flat after fulfilling the MOP from the date the flat(s) purchase is completed and in accordance with the prevailing resale policy.

#### Taking a housing subsidy

##### Purchase of 2 adjoining flats

If you take a CPF housing grant for the purchase of 2 adjoining flats, you will be a second-timer and need to pay a resale levy based on the flat type of the converted flat when buying a second subsidised housing.

##### Purchase of flat adjoining to your current unit

If your current flat is bought from HDB or a resale flat bought with a CPF Housing Grant and you are buying 1 adjoining flat, the following will apply:



* Current Flat: First subsidised flat
  * Treatment: You are a second-timer and have to pay a resale levy when you sell the converted flat.
* Current Flat: Second subsidised flat
  * Treatment: You are no longer eligible to buy another flat from HDB.


#### Sub-dividing of converted flat

|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Before polling         |Payment will be based on the flat type of the converted flat    |
|During or after polling|Payment will be based on the total upgrading cost for both flats|


# HDB | Mode of Financing
Plan your finances and work out your budget before you search for a suitable home.

To work out a financial plan, consider the following:

*   Payments that you need to make by using cash and CPF savings
*   The amount of housing loan
*   CPF housing grant(s)

You can use our [calculators](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator) to estimate your finances and the amount of housing loan you may need for your flat purchase. Read [working out your flat budget](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/working-out-your-flat-budget) for more tips on financing a flat purchase.

[

Cash and CPF savings

  *             You must pay the balance purchase price of the flat before or during the resale completion appointment, after factoring in:                            Initial payment                Any CPF housing grant(s)                CPF Ordinary Account savings                Eligible housing loan amount                        Read more about the resale completion appointment.            : If you are taking a second HDB housing loan, you have to use part of the cash proceeds from the disposal of an existing or previous flat to pay for your flat purchase, so as to reduce the loan amount required, for financial prudence. 
* Amount not covered by CPF savings and eligible housing loan amount: Others
  *             You must pay the balance purchase price of the flat before or during the resale completion appointment, after factoring in:                            Initial payment                Any CPF housing grant(s)                CPF Ordinary Account savings                Eligible housing loan amount                        Read more about the resale completion appointment.            :             E.g.:                            Fire insurance                Home Protection Insurance premium                Other expenses such as furnishings, renovation                        


#### CPF savings

The savings in your CPF Ordinary Account (OA) can be used for:



* Legal fees: Initial payment
  * The legal fees will depend on the solicitor you appoint to act for you.:             You may use your CPF savings to pay for the initial payment.            If you are taking a housing loan from a financial institution (FI), at least 5% of the initial payment have to be in cash.

  * The legal fees will depend on the solicitor you appoint to act for you.: The monthly payments will start after the resale completion.


Flat buyers taking a housing loan from HDB have the option of retaining up to $20,000 of the available [CPF savings](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/home-ownership/using-your-cpf-to-buy-a-home/retain-20000-in-your-oa-if-you-are-taking-a-housing-loan) in each buyer's OA. The remaining balance in the CPF OA must be used to pay for the flat purchase, before they can take an HDB housing loan. If you need the CPF refund from the sale of your current property to finance the resale flat purchase, please ensure the amount has already been credited to your CPF OA, before you submit the resale application.

You should also take note of the following conditions for using your CPF savings:

*   There is a limit on the total amount of CPF savings that can be used for your flat purchase. Once that limit is reached, you will not be able to withdraw more of your CPF savings and have to pay the balance flat purchase price and/ or monthly mortgage instalments in cash
*   The total amount of CPF savings that can be used for your flat purchase and/ or paying monthly mortgage instalments will depend on the extent the remaining lease of the flat can cover the youngest buyer up to the age of 95. You can get the details of a flat's lease at [HDB Map Services](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/fi10/emap.html). Details on the use of CPF savings and the applicable limits are shown in the table below:
    
    

* Remaining lease of flat is at least 20 years and can cover the youngest buyer up to the age of 95                : Yes
  * Applicable Limits for CPF Usage: The amount use is capped at the lower of the value of flat or price of the flat at the time of purchase.
* Remaining lease of flat is at least 20 years and can cover the youngest buyer up to the age of 95                : No
  * Applicable Limits for CPF Usage: The amount is pro-rated based on the extent the remaining lease of the flat can cover the youngest buyer up to the age of 95. When the allowed CPF amount is used up, buyers have to pay the balance flat purchase price and/ or monthly mortgage instalments in cash. This will help buyers to set aside CPF savings for their housing needs during retirement (e.g. buying a replacement property).

    

For information on the use of CPF savings, you may use the CPF Board's [online calculator](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tools-and-services/calculators/cpf-housing-usage). For further enquiries on the use of CPF savings, please visit CPF Board’s [website](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/home-ownership/using-your-cpf-to-buy-a-home).

[

Housing loan
------------

To finance your flat purchase, you may choose to take a housing loan from HDB or a financial institution (FI) regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

](#Housingloan-2)

Buying a flat is a long-term commitment, and mortgage payments can stretch up to 25 years or more. Hence, it is important to exercise financial prudence so that you can sustain the monthly payments.

Housing loan from HDB
---------------------

The rest of the available CPF OA balances must be used to pay for the flat purchase.            
* Valid HFE letter: Remaining lease of flat
  *             You will need a valid HFE letter at all of the following stages:                            Before obtaining an Option to Purchase (OTP) from a flat seller                When you exercise the OTP                When you submit the resale application                        :             If the lease can cover the youngest core member up to the age of 95 and above, the Loan-to-Value (LTV) limit will be 75%^ of the lower of the resale price and value.

* Valid HFE letter: Refinancing to housing loan from financial institution (FI)
  *             You will need a valid HFE letter at all of the following stages:                            Before obtaining an Option to Purchase (OTP) from a flat seller                When you exercise the OTP                When you submit the resale application                        : You may refinance the HDB housing loan for your flat with a housing loan from an FI.


If you are not eligible for a housing loan from HDB but need financing for your flat purchase, please obtain a loan from an FI.

Housing loan from financial institutions
----------------------------------------

You may choose to finance your flat purchase with a [housing loan from the FIs](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-financial-institutions) regulated by [Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)](https://www.mas.gov.sg/). View and compare the [housing loan packages](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator/fi-loan-package) offered by the participating FIs on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard).

Check the key terms and considerations in taking up a housing loan from the FIs before deciding. You can use our [calculator](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator/budget) to obtain housing loan estimates from the FIs.

When applying for an HFE letter on the [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard), you may also apply for an In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the participating FIs, which will provide you with a preliminary assessment of your housing loan eligibility. Before you exercise an Option to Purchase, you may request to convert your IPA into a Letter of Offer via the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing).

Do take note of the following:



* Valid Letter of Offer (LO): Refinancing to housing loan from financial institution (FI)
  * You must have a valid LO before exercising the OTP.: When you take a housing loan from an FI, you may refinance it a housing loan from the same or different FI, but not from HDB.


[

CPF housing grants
------------------

You may be eligible to receive a housing subsidy to help with the purchase of your resale flat.

# HDB | Option to Purchase
After you have obtained a valid [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter), considered your [mode of financing](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/mode-of-financing) and worked out your budget, you may proceed to look for a suitable flat that meets your budget. Once you have decided on a flat and agreed on a price for it, you may proceed to obtain an Option to Purchase (OTP) from the flat sellers.

If you intend to get an [HDB housing loan](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-hdb), you must have a valid HFE letter from HDB before the flat sellers may grant you an OTP. If you intend to get a [housing loan from a financial institution](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-financial-institutions), you must have a valid Letter of Offer (LO) before you exercise the OTP. You may concurrently request an In-Principle Approval and LO from participating financial institutions when applying for the HFE letter through [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard).

You and the flat sellers must use the [HDB-prescribed OTP](http://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB24OTPDlWeb/BB24POptionToPurchase.jsp) for the resale transaction. Any other agreements and/ or supplementary agreements relating to the sale or purchase of the flat are not valid under the Housing and Development Act.

Print only 1 copy of the OTP as each form has a unique serial number. You must state the serial number of the OTP when you submit a resale application to HDB.

The OTP is a legally binding contract between you and the flat sellers. Read the [Important Notes of the OTP](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/doc/EAPG-CSC/OTP-Important-Notes-4-Sep-2024.ashx) and the [Terms and Conditions of Resale](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/doc/EAPG-CSC/Resale-Terms--Conditions-9-May-2023-updated.ashx) carefully before entering into a contract.

Deposit to sellers
------------------

You must pay flat sellers an Option Fee when they grant you an OTP, and an Option Exercise Fee when you exercise the OTP.

You may negotiate the amounts of Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee with the flat sellers, which will form part of the resale price.



* Payment by flat buyers to sellers: Option Fee
  * Stage of OTP: Granting of OTP
  * Amount to pay: Between $1 and $1,000
* Payment by flat buyers to sellers: Option Exercise Fee
  * Stage of OTP: Exercising of OTP
  * Amount to pay: An amount, which when including the Option Fee, will not exceed $5,000


You are encouraged to make payment using digital payment modes to secure independent proof of payment.

Procedure to enter into a contract using the OTP
------------------------------------------------

[![OTP process Jul 2023](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/EAPG/EAPG-CSC/OTP-process-Jul-2023.ashx?h=165%25&w=80%25&hash=36773C5FF9FA3C23F27D552DA16A1587)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/EAPG/EAPG-CSC/OTP-process-Jul-2023.ashx)

Read the steps below for more details.

[

Step 1: Negotiate and agree on the resale price
-----------------------------------------------

You and the flat sellers must mutually agree on the resale price of the flat.

](#StepaNegotiateandagreeontheresaleprice-1)

You may use the [resale flat prices e-service](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB33RTIS/BB33PReslTrans.jsp) to check the transacted resale flat prices to help you make an informed decision on how much to pay for the flat. The figures are updated daily based on HDB’s registration of the resale applications received.



* Before entering into an OTP: When entering the OTP
  *             Ensure that you have obtained a valid HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter via My Flat Dashboard.            :             You and the flat sellers must declare the true resale price of the flat to HDB, and must not enter into any supplementary/ other agreements or arrangements that may cause the resale price as declared to be inflated or understated.            Note: It is an offence to give false information relating to the resale application - HDB may take the necessary action(s) as stated in the Terms & Conditions, Option to Purchase and Application Form(s).            


[

Step 2: Sellers grant the OTP to you
------------------------------------

The flat sellers will grant you the OTP to buy the resale flat at the agreed resale price.

](#StepaSellersgranttheOTPtoyou-2)

Completing the OTP
------------------

The flat sellers must fill in these sections in the OTP:



* Page: 1
  * Sections:                             Option Date                Flat address                Purchase price (resale price of the flat)                Option Fee (between $1 to $1,000)                Option expiry date (21 calendar days from the option day, including Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays. For e.g., if the flat sellers grant an Option to you on 1 April, the Option will expire on 22 April at 4pm)                Names (as in NRIC) and NRIC numbers of all the flat sellers and buyers                        
* Page: 2
  * Sections: Clause 6.1(c): Option Exercise Fee
* Page: 4
  * Sections: Clause 12: Number of days from the date of exercising the Option that you and the flat sellers have agreed to submit the resale application to HDB
* Page: 8 (top half)
  * Sections:                             Option Date                Flat address                All flat sellers must sign on the OTP                A witness may sign on the OTP (seller's salesperson or any person, aged 21 years or above, and not involved in the resale transaction)                        
* Page: 9 (optional)
  * Sections: Inventory list of the flat
* Page: 10 (optional)
  * Sections: Authorisation for another person to receive the Acceptance of the flat buyers when they exercise the OTP


Option Fee
----------

At this stage, you do not have to sign on the OTP. However, you must pay an Option Fee to the flat sellers. The Option Fee should be a sum between $1 and $1,000, to be mutually agreed between you and the flat sellers.

Once the flat sellers have granted the OTP to you, they cannot grant another OTP to other flat buyers until the OTP granted to you has expired.

[

Step 3: Review purchase during Option Period
--------------------------------------------

The OTP is valid for 21 calendar days from the date the OTP is granted.

](#StepaReviewpurchaseduringOptionPeriod-3)

The Option Period is 21 calendar days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and Public Holidays). It is given to you by the flat sellers, from the date of granting the OTP (refer to Step 2). 

You should use the Option Period wisely and not rush into exercising the OTP. During this period, you must log in to [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) to:



* Confirm mode of financing: Request for Value of Flat
  * Confirm your mode of financing (i.e., cash, CPF savings, and/ or a housing loan) for your flat purchase in My Flat Dashboard.:             You must submit a Request for Value for the flat if you are using your CPF savings and/ or taking up a housing loan to finance your flat purchase. You may submit the request via My Flat Dashboard after the flat sellers have granted you the OTP.            Once you have made the request, you can log in to My Flat Dashboard to view the progress and outcome.            


[

Step 4: Exercise the OTP or allow OTP to expire
-----------------------------------------------

To proceed with the flat purchase, you must exercise the OTP within the Option Period. Otherwise, you must wait for the OTP to expire.

](#StepaExercisetheOTPorallowOTPtoexpire-4)

Proceed with flat purchase: Exercise the OTP
--------------------------------------------

To proceed with the flat purchase, you must exercise the OTP during the Option Period. If you are taking a housing loan or using your CPF savings to pay for the flat, ensure that the flat value\* is available before you exercise the OTP.

\* Read [request for value](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/request-for-value) for more information.

#### Housing loan from HDB

If you are taking a housing loan from HDB, ensure that you have a valid [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter).

#### Housing loan from a financial institution (FI)

If you are taking a housing loan from a FI, ensure that you have a valid Letter of Offer (LO). The date of issue of the LO must be on or before you exercise the OTP. You may concurrently request an In-Principle Approval and LO from participating financial institutions when applying for the [HFE letter](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp27/PrelimHFE/)^ on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard).

#### Signing and returning the OTP

To exercise the Option, you must sign on the OTP and return it to the flat sellers:



* Page: 8 (bottom half)
  * Sections:                             You and all your co-buyers must sign on the “ACCEPTANCE” section                A witness may sign on the OTP (your salesperson or any person, aged 21 years or above, and not involved in the resale transaction)                        


#### Option Exercise Fee

When you exercise the OTP, you need to pay an Option Exercise Fee to the flat sellers. The amount, as stated in Step 2, is to be mutually agreed upon between you and the flat sellers.

Not proceeding with flat purchase: Allow OTP to expire
------------------------------------------------------

If you do not wish to proceed with the purchase, you need not take any further action. Upon expiry of the OTP, you will forfeit the Option Fee and you do not need to continue with Step 5.

[

Step 5: Submit the resale application
-------------------------------------

After you have exercised the OTP, you and the sellers must decide when to submit the respective portions of the resale application to HDB.

](#StepaSubmittheresaleapplication-5)

You and the flat sellers must both submit the respective portions of the resale application separately within both timeframes:

*   Within the agreed number of days as stated on page 4 of the OTP, and
*   Within 7 days of each other’s submission

A resale application is only complete when HDB has received both you and the flat sellers' respective portions of the resale application and the necessary supporting documents.

Read about [submitting a resale application](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application) and what you need to do before the application is [accepted and approved](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/acceptance-and-approval).

**Important note:**

The applicant(s) and occupier(s) listed in your resale flat application must remain the same as those in your HFE letter application.

If you need to make any changes to your HFE letter, e.g. addition/ removal of household member(s), change in status from an applicant to an occupier or vice versa, marital status, citizenship, ownership of private properties, etc., please follow the steps below:



* Submitted a resale application: No
  * Steps to take:                             Cancel your HFE letter                After cancellation, apply for a fresh HFE letter (i.e. complete Step 1 and Step 2 of the buying process again) via My Flat Dashboard                                        
* Submitted a resale application: Yes
  * Steps to take: Write to us via MyRequest@HDB with your resale case number. We will advise you further.

# HDB | Request for Value
After the sellers have granted you an [Option to Purchase (OTP)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/option-to-purchase), the Option Period will commence from the Option Date, i.e., the date of granting the OTP. The Option Period is 21 calendar days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and Public Holidays).

During this period, you must:

*   Log in to [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) to confirm your [mode of financing](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/mode-of-financing), and make a Request for Value
*   After the outcome of the Request for Value is available, confirm your decision whether to buy the flat

The Request for Value will determine the flat’s value and form the basis for your CPF usage and/ or the reference for the housing loan amount from HDB or the financial institution (FI), unless otherwise advised by the FI.

If you are using cash only (i.e., no CPF usage and no housing loan) to pay for your flat purchase, you do not need to submit a Request for Value.

Submit your Request for Value
-----------------------------

You must submit the Request for Value via [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) by the next working day after the Option Date, together with a scanned copy of Page 1 of the OTP. You have to pay a processing fee of $120 (including GST) to HDB.

If you have engaged the services of a salesperson, your salesperson may make the Request for Value on your behalf via [e-Resale](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31ERESALE3/BB31SMain) or [Estate Agent Toolkit](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWEstateAgent/BB31SMain) (for agencies which are subscribers).

If a valuation of the flat is required, the appointed valuer will contact the flat seller to arrange for a flat inspection.

You will be informed, via email, once the outcome of your Request for Value is available in My Flat Dashboard. The outcome is typically available within 10 working days from the date of your request.

##### Important note:

*   The outcome of the Request for Value is valid for 3 months, from the day it is made available in My Flat Dashboard. You and the flat sellers must submit the respective portions of the resale application\* during this 3-month period. Otherwise, you will have to submit a new Request for Value for the same transaction  
    \* A resale application is considered complete only when HDB receives both buyers’ and sellers’ portions of resale application and the necessary supporting documents.
*   You have to wait for the outcome of the Request for Value before you may exercise the OTP during the Option Period

# HDB | Application 
After you have exercised the [Option to Purchase (OTP)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/option-to-purchase), you and the sellers must submit the respective portions of the resale application and the necessary supporting documents via [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard). Salespersons may submit resale applications on behalf of their clients via [e-Resale](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31ERESALE3/BB31SMain) or [Estate Agent Toolkit](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWEstateAgent/BB31SMain) (for agencies which are subscribers).

Upon receiving the resale application and supporting documents, HDB will verify the information provided by you and the sellers. Both parties must ensure that they are eligible for the transaction.

If the application and documents are in order, we will notify you and the sellers of HDB’s acceptance of the application via SMS or email. Thereafter, it will take about 8 weeks to process the application and complete the transaction. This is the earliest possible date to complete the transaction. If you wish to defer the completion, please discuss with your sellers and let us have a written confirmation (signed by both sellers and buyers) via [MyRequest@HDB](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BE15AWMyRequest/BE15PMain).

[

When to submit the resale application
-------------------------------------

You and the sellers may proceed to submit the resale application and the necessary documents after you have exercised the OTP.

](#Whentosubmittheresaleapplication-1)

Both parties must submit the respective portions of the resale application and all the necessary documents, according to the following time-specific requirements:



* (i) Submission by the second party within 7 calendar days: (ii) Submission of application to HDB (according to Clause 12 of the OTP)
  * Either you or the sellers may submit the respective portion of the resale application and the necessary documents first. Thereafter, the second party must submit their portion within 7 calendar days. If this is not done, the application will lapse and both parties have to restart the application process and pay the application fees.:             Under Clause 12 of the OTP, you and the sellers have agreed on the timeframe to submit the resale application to us.            This is a contractual term between you and the sellers. Any variation requires the mutual agreement of both parties            


A resale application is complete only when HDB receives both buyers’ and sellers’ portions of resale application and the necessary supporting documents. Otherwise, the application will lapse and both parties have to restart the application process and pay the application fees. Application fees are non-refundable.

[

Information required for resale application
-------------------------------------------

You need to provide the listed information when you submit the resale application.

](#Informationrequiredforresaleapplication-2)

You must provide the following information:



* Option to Purchase details: Buyers’ and occupiers’ particulars
  *                             Address of the flat you are buying                Sellers’ particulars (such as name and NRIC)                OTP Serial Number                Option Date                Purchase Price                Option Fee                Option Exercise Fee                Acceptance Date                        :             You must verify and provide the details of all applicants and occupiers listed in the application and submit all the supporting documents (in PDF or JPG format). The list of documents required will be provided in My Flat Dashboard when you submit your resale application. Do note that the information provided should be the same to those given in your HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter.            If you need to make any changes, e.g. addition/ removal of household member(s), change in status from an applicant to an occupier or vice versa, marital status, citizenship, ownership of private properties, etc., you must first cancel your HFE letter.

\* Fees paid are non-refundable and include GST.

[

After submission of resale application
--------------------------------------

You and the sellers must submit your respective portion of the resale application within 7 calendar days. Otherwise, the application will be cancelled, and the application fees paid are non-refundable.

](#Aftersubmissionofresaleapplication-4)

Upon receiving a complete resale application and the full set of the supporting documents from you and the sellers, we will verify the eligibility of both parties, and review the supporting documents.

If the application is in order, we will notify both parties of HDB’s acceptance within 28 working days, via SMS and emails. You may log in to [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) to view the status of your resale application.

The date of HDB’s acceptance of the resale application marks the beginning of the 8 weeks processing time. The resale completion date stated in HDB's acceptance letter is the earliest possible date to complete the transaction. You and the flat sellers may mutually agree on a later date and submit the request via [MyRequest@HDB](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BE15AWMyRequest/BE15PMain).

During these 8 weeks, you have to endorse documents which HDB has prepared for you through My Flat Dashboard and pay the necessary fees online. An approval for resale will be granted once the documents are endorsed and the payments made. We will notify you and the sellers of the resale completion appointment once it is scheduled. If you have submitted a resale application with a valid HFE letter that is expiring before the resale completion, you may continue with your resale application without the need to apply for a fresh HFE letter.

[

----------------------------------

](#Cancellationofresaleapplication-5)

Your application will be cancelled if:

*   You or the sellers have decided to withdraw the application by giving notice in writing to us
*   You do not have sufficient funds to complete the flat purchase
*   The information given in the resale application is incorrect or either party has suppressed any information required (in addition to any other actions that HDB may take or penalties that HDB may impose) 
*   You or the sellers are not eligible to retain the application under HDB's prevailing policies
*   The transaction is aborted for any reasons whatsoever

Additional Information
----------------------

[

Manner of holding
-----------------

If there is more than one buyer in your resale application, you must state the manner of holding to determine the share of ownership of the flat.

](#Mannerofholding-1)

Joint Tenancy
-------------

All the flat owners have an equal share on the flat regardless of how much each co-owner may have contributed to buy the flat.

The right of survivorship applies. This means that should any co-owner passes away, his/ her interest in the flat will be automatically passed on to the remaining co-owner(s). This is regardless of whether a will has been made by the deceased co-owner.

Tenancy-in-common
-----------------

Each co-owner holds a separate and definite share in the flat. Nevertheless, all the co-owners are entitled to use the whole flat, regardless of their share.

The right of survivorship does not apply. On the death of any co-owner, his/ her interest in the flat will be distributed according to his/ her will (if any). If there is no will, the interest in the flat will be distributed to his/ her beneficiaries in accordance with the Intestate Succession Act.

[

Ownership of property
---------------------

You and all the people listed in the application must declare any interest in any private property when submitting the resale application.

](#Ownershipofproperty-2)

The declaration includes private residential, commercial (including market/ hawker stalls), and industrial properties, both in Singapore and overseas.

Read [Flat and Grant Eligibility](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility) to understand the eligibility conditions for buying a resale flat, including non-ownership of private residential property.

[

Power of Attorney
-----------------

When buying or selling an HDB flat, certain matters must be attended to at different stages of the process. The POA is required if you are unable to attend to these matters personally.

](#PowerofAttorney-3)

A Power of Attorney (POA) is a legal document that allows a person ('donor') to appoint another person ('attorney') to act on his behalf and in his name on matters specified in the POA.

As a flat buyer, you must sign documents personally, such as:

*   Option to Purchase
*   Application forms
*   Declarations forms
*   Legal documents

If you are unable to attend to these matters personally, you have to approach a solicitor to prepare a POA to act on your behalf in the flat purchase. 

What must you and your private solicitor do?
--------------------------------------------



* Steps: Step 1: Preparing the POA
  * Process: Engage a solicitor to prepare the POA.
* Steps: Step 2: Signing the POA
  * Process:             The POA has to be signed by you in the presence of your solicitor. If you are already overseas, you must sign the POA in the presence of one of the following parties:                            Notary Public*                Diplomatic or consular official from a Singapore Overseas Mission. Please visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)’ website to find the nearest Singapore Overseas Mission                        * If you are using CPF Ordinary Account (OA) savings to buy a flat, the POA must be witnessed and sealed/ stamped by an official from a Singapore Overseas Mission instead. You may visit the MFA's website for more details on the nearest Singapore Overseas Mission.            
* Steps: Step 3: Registering the POA
  * Process: After your POA has been signed, your solicitor will register the POA with the High Court Registry.
* Steps: Step 4: Submitting required documents to HDB
  * Process:             Once the POA has been registered, you have to state this in the application form and submit the following documents to us:                            Certified true copy from the High Court + 2 photocopies                2 certified true copies of the POA registered with the High Court by an Advocate and Solicitor                A letter from the solicitor confirming that the standard format for POA provided by HDB has been used                Certified true copy by an Advocate and Solicitor together with the computer printout with the High Court seal where POA has been registered through the Electronic Filing System                        


##### Important points to note:

*   If you are travelling overseas, you are advised to obtain the POA before leaving the country
*   The POA cannot be used for the signing of the following documents, which you must sign personally:
    *   Application form
    *   Statutory declarations (you must sign in the presence of a Commissioner of Oaths or Notary Public)
    *   Any undertakings
*   If you have submitted an original POA or a certified true copy of the POA from the High Court to us, it will be returned to your solicitor. This is after the Lease & Mortgage document has been registered with the Singapore Land Authority
*   However, certified true copies of the POA by your solicitors will be retained by HDB

[

Bankruptcy
----------

You are required to indicate in your application form if you are an undischarged bankrupt.

](#Bankruptcy-4)

If you are an undischarged bankrupt, prior consent must be obtained from the Official Assignee (OA) or the private trustee, if:

*   You are applying to buy an HDB flat that is bigger than a 5-room flat or a 3Gen flat
*   You are buying any flat type with a net purchase price of $500,000 or above, after taking into account any HDB subsidies or levy

You do not need to seek consent from the OA or private trustee if you are listed as an occupier of a flat.

Acknowledge and endorse resale documents
----------------------------------------

You and the sellers must endorse the documents before HDB may approve the resale application.

Arrow down icon](#Acknowledgeandendorseresaledocuments-1)

We will prepare the necessary documents for you and the sellers to endorse, which will be ready about 3 weeks after the application have been accepted.

Once the documents are ready, they will be posted on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard), and we will notify you and the sellers via SMS to log in to My Flat Dashboard to endorse the documents.

If you or the sellers do not endorse the documents within the given timeframe, the resale application may be cancelled.

If you appoint HDB as the solicitors for the purchase of the flat, the documents to endorse include:

**Buyer’s financial plan**

A proposed financial plan based on what you have stated in your resale application.

If you wish to make changes to the draft financial plan, please revise and endorse the financial plan in My Flat Dashboard.

**CPF withdrawal**

The CPF withdrawal based on the endorsed financial plan.

Please ensure that all the buyers have sufficient savings in the CPF Ordinary Accounts for the payment. If there are insufficient funds in the CPF accounts at the point of the deduction, you have to pay any shortfall in cash.

**Health declaration for CPF Board’s Home Protection Scheme**

If you are taking an HDB housing loan and/ or using your CPF savings to pay for the flat purchase, you must fill up a Health Declaration form to declare your share of the insurance coverage and health status, for the CPF Board’s Home Protection Scheme (HPS).

**Resale documents**

You must endorse all the undertakings and forms posted on My Flat Dashboard.

If you have applied for the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) ([Families](/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/proximity-housing-grant-families) or [Singles](/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/singles/proximity-housing-grant-singles)), your parents or child will also need to endorse the undertakings on My Flat Dashboard. They will need to log in the dashboard via their Singpass.

If you appoint your own solicitors for the purchase of the flat, the documents that you will endorse may be different from the above.

##### Important note:

*   The resale documents must be endorsed individually by all the buyers. Read through the documents before endorsing them. The documents are in PDF format and you may save a copy for reference
*   You can check the status of the endorsement process via My Flat Dashboard

# HDB | Request for Enhanced Contra Facility
With the Enhanced Contra Facility (ECF), you may:

*   Sell your existing HDB flat and buy another resale HDB flat by using the cash proceeds and refunded CPF savings\* from the flat sale at the same time
*   Reduce the out-of-pocket payments needed for your resale flat purchase
*   Reduce the housing loan amount needed and the monthly instalment payments

\* Refunded CPF savings and cash proceeds from the flat sale cannot be used for the payment of stamp duty and legal fees.

[

Application for ECF
-------------------

You must state the request for ECF in the resale application form.

](#ApplicationforECF-1)

Before submission of resale application
---------------------------------------

If you would like to make use of the ECF, you must state so in the [resale application](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application) form via the [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard). Salespersons may request for the ECF in the application form on behalf of their clients via [e-Resale](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31ERESALE3/BB31SMain) or [Estate Agent Toolkit](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWEstateAgent/BB31SMain) (for agencies which are subscribers).

Submission of resale applications for ECF
-----------------------------------------

For resale transactions with ECF, there are 3 parties involved. You can refer to the following example.

#### Example

Mr C is selling his flat (Flat A) and buying a resale flat (Flat B) at the same time. He is applying for the ECF and is therefore the contra party. He needs to submit 2 sets of resale applications:

1.  The seller’s portion of the resale application to sell Flat A; and
2.  The buyer’s portion of the resale application to buy Flat B

The 2 resale applications will be submitted separately. In both applications, only Mr C is required to state that he is applying for the ECF, and to provide the addresses of the flats that he is selling and buying, in the respective resale application, as illustrated below.

![ecf infographic 042022](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/EAPG/EAPG-CSC/ECF-example.ashx?h=448&w=1106)

All parties must submit their respective resale applications and the necessary supporting documents within 7 days.

[

ECF terms and conditions
------------------------

Please note the terms and conditions for the ECF, which include important information about application conditions, usage of cash proceeds and CPF funds, approval conditions, and cancellation of the ECF.

](#Confirmationofresalecompletionappointment-1)

We will notify you via SMS on the specific date and time of your resale completion once it is confirmed and post the information on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard).

If you have appointed HDB as the solicitors for the purchase of the flat, you have to attend the appointment in person at the HDB Resale Office, HDB Hub.

If you have appointed private solicitors, your solicitors’ representative may attend the appointment on your behalf. You need to confirm with your solicitors on the arrangement.

#### If you are unable to attend the resale completion appointment

If you are unable to attend the resale completion appointment personally, e.g., you are overseas, you can prepare a [Power of Attorney](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application?anchor=poa) to appoint another person to act on your behalf and attend the resale completion. Certified true copies of the Power of Attorney have to be submitted to HDB at least 1 week before the appointment.

[

Inspect the flat

If the sellers have a valid HDB fire insurance for the flat, you need not buy another fire insurance. However, you will need to renew the fire insurance policy when the existing policy expires.

You are encouraged to buy additional home contents insurance from any insurer if you wish to extend protection over your home contents that are not covered under the HDB fire insurance.

For those who are not taking a housing loan, you are also encouraged to buy fire and home contents insurance for your flat. You may do so from any insurer.

[

Pay the balance purchase price and outstanding stamp fees
---------------------------------------------------------

* Payment Modes: Cashier’s Order
  * Details: Payable to HDB
* Payment Modes:             NETS (using AXS)            For payments less than $9,999

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE AND PURCHASE
OF AN HDB RESALE FLAT
APPLICABLE TO BOTH SELLER AND BUYER
1 HDB RESALE PROCESS
1.1 The sale and purchase of an HDB flat (“the flat”) in the resale market shall be carried out according
to the procedures and processes that HDB may determine from time to time.

1.2 The seller must register an Intent to Sell and the buyer an Intent to Buy in the HDB Resale Portal
(or any mode that HDB may introduce from time to time) before they proceed with the sale or
purchase of the flat. All data/information provided by the seller and buyer must be true and
accurate.

1.3 The seller must register the Intent to Sell in the HDB Resale Portal at least seven (7) days before
granting an Option to Purchase to the buyer. The buyer must register the Intent to Buy before
being granted an Option to Purchase by the seller.

4 The information furnished in the HDB Resale Portal to the seller or buyer following the registration
of the Intent to Sell or Intent to Buy are based on the data and information provided by the seller
or buyer and may be subject to change if there are any new data or information or new policies
which affect their eligibility to sell or buy the flat.
5 The seller or buyer as stated in the Intent to Sell or Intent to Buy, Option to Purchase, Request for
Value and resale application must be the same. In the event of any difference or change in the
seller or buyer, HDB may require the seller or buyer to re-register the Intent to Sell or Intent to
Buy, reject the resale application or take whatever action that HDB may decide in order for HDB
to process the Option to Purchase, Request for Value and resale application.
2 OPTION TO PURCHASE

2 .1 The seller and buyer must use the HDB prescribed Option to Purchase as the form of contract for
the sale and purchase of the flat in the resale market (“the resale”). The seller and buyer are not
allowed to enter into any other agreement as it is null and void pursuant to the Housing &
Development Act.

2 .2 No amendments may be made to the prescribed Option to Purchase form. Amendments include
(but are not limited to) deletions, insertions or altering any provision in the prescribed Option to
Purchase. The seller and buyer must comply with all the procedures and requirements set out in
the “Important Notes on Option to Purchase” as well as these Terms and Conditions.

3 The prescribed Option Fee, Deposit and Option Period are as follows:
Option Fee - An amount not exceeding $1,
Deposit - An amount not exceeding $5,000 (Option Fee + Option Exercise Fee = Deposit)
Option Period - 21 calendar days (including Sat/Sun & public holidays) after the Option Date.
The Option expiry time is standardised at 4pm.
4 The Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee will form the “Deposit” (an agreed amount of up to
$5,000) for the purchase. Neither the Option Fee nor the Option Exercise Fee can be $0. This is
to ensure that there is a valid Option or contract.
HOUSING &
DEVELOPMENT
BOARD
2.5 After the seller has granted an Option to Purchase to a buyer, he cannot sell the flat, grant another
Option to Purchase or make an offer to other buyers during the Option Period.

6 The buyer who is eligible for and intends to obtain an HDB housing loan must have a valid HDB
Loan Eligibility Letter when the seller grants him the Option to Purchase. The HDB Loan Eligibility
Letter is valid for 6 months from the date of issue.

7 The buyer who is taking a bank loan must have a valid Letter of Offer from a bank/financial
institution when he exercises the Option to Purchase.

3 DECLARED RESALE PRICE

3.1 The seller and buyer must declare to HDB the true resale price of the flat. The seller and buyer
shall not enter into any supplementary or other agreements or arrangements that may cause the
resale price as declared to be inflated or understated.

3.2 Where applicable, the declared resale price may be referred to as the resale price or the purchase
price or the selling price.

3.3 The declared resale price shall be stated in the Option to Purchase, the resale application form
and other documents as required by HDB to process the resale application. There shall not be
any change to the declared resale price. If there is any variation in the declared resale price, HDB
has the right to reject or cancel the resale application.

3.4 HDB may require the seller and/or the buyer to furnish a written explanation on the difference if
the declared resale price is below the value of the flat as referred to in clause 4.1.

3.5 If the reason given for the difference between the declared resale price and the value of the flat is
deemed not acceptable by HDB, HDB may withhold the acceptance of or cancel the resale
application.

4 REQUEST FOR VALUE

4 .1 The buyer who is financing the purchase of the flat with CPF savings or a housing loan from HDB
or bank/financial institution must submit a request to HDB (“Request for Value”) to determine the
value of the flat which forms the basis for his CPF usage and/or the reference for a housing loan
from HDB or bank/financial institution, unless otherwise advised by a bank/financial institution
(“value of the flat”).

4 .2 Only the buyer who has been granted an Option to Purchase by the seller of the flat shall submit
a Request for Value.

4 .3 The buyer must (by himself or through his salesperson if he engages one) submit the Request for
Value by the next working day after the Option Date as stated in the Option to Purchase granted
by the seller of the flat.

4 .4 HDB has the sole discretion to decide whether a valuation of the flat is required to confirm the
value of the flat. If HDB requires a valuation of the flat, HDB will assign any of the private valuation
firms on HDB’s Panel of Valuers to conduct the valuation.

4.5 The buyer by submitting the Request for Value agrees to accept HDB’s decision whether a
valuation of the flat is required and the valuation (if any) conducted by HDB’s assigned valuer.
The buyer shall not specify any valuer to be assigned by HDB.

4.6 In granting the Option to Purchase, the seller agrees to the valuation of the flat, if required by HDB.
He must, within three (3) working days after the day of HDB’s notification of the assigned valuer,
allow the assigned valuer to enter the flat at any time in the day to inspect the flat for the valuation.

7 HDB's acceptance of the buyer’s Request for Value does not constitute an approval for the resale
of the flat. Approval from HDB for the resale has to be separately obtained.
8 Once HDB has received the Request for Value, HDB will not accept another Request for Value
for the same flat from the same buyer or a different buyer until the Option to Purchase (referred to
in clause 4.2) expires. HDB has the absolute discretion to determine when the next Request for
Value may be submitted.
4 .9 The buyer can check the status of the Request for Value from the HDB Resale Portal.

4 .10 The value of the flat only applies to the Option to Purchase (referred to in clause 4.2) and is not
valid for use in another resale transaction involving the same buyer under a different Option to
Purchase for the same flat or another buyer of the flat, for which a new Request for Value must
be submitted.

4 .1 1 The value of the flat will remain valid for a period of 3 months from the day it is made available in
the HDB Resale Portal. If the buyer does not submit a resale application within the 3-month validity
period, he will have to submit a new Request for Value. In this event, the housing loan amount to
be granted by HDB or bank/financial institution and the use of CPF savings for the purchase of
the flat will be based on the value of the flat determined via the new Request for Value.

4 .1 2 If there is a valuation, HDB retains all rights to the valuation and any resulting valuation report.

4 .1 3 The buyer and seller must comply with the requirements and procedures for the Request for Value
as determined by HDB from time to time in accordance with the prevailing policies, rules and
regulations.

4 .1 4 Any reference to working day means Monday to Friday, which is not a public holiday.

5 ACCEPTANCE OF RESALE APPLICATION
5.1 HDB will determine the information and documents required to process the resale application, and
the manner of their submission.

5.2 The submission of the resale application by the seller and buyer, and its receipt by HDB, do not
mean the acceptance of the resale application by HDB.

5.3 The acceptance of the resale application is subject to:

(a) The seller and the buyer satisfying the approved ethnic ratios and limits set for the
Neighbourhood and Apartment Block under the Ethnic Integration Policy and the Singapore
Permanent Resident Quota policy as at the date of submission of the resale application.
(b) HDB’s receipt and verification of the information (including consistency with any information
provided by the seller at the Intent to Sell and the buyer at the Intent to Buy) and documents
submitted by the seller and buyer that are required by HDB to process the resale application.
5.4 HDB in its sole and absolute discretion reserves the right not to accept the resale application if:

(a) the seller did not register the Intent to Sell at least seven (7) days before granting the Option
to Purchase to the buyer or the buyer did not register the Intent to Buy before being granted
the Option to Purchase; or
(b) the required information and documents are not submitted within the timeframe as requested
by HDB; or for any reason HDB may decide at its sole discretion.
5 The acceptance of the resale application does not constitute an approval by HDB for the resale.
HDB’s written approval for the resale must still be obtained before the resale completion can take
place.
6 APPOINTING HDB AS A SOLICITOR
Where HDB is appointed by the seller and/or buyer to act in the resale, HDB’s conveyancing fees
shall be calculated in accordance with the Housing and Development (Conveyancing Fees) Rules.
HDB in its sole and absolute discretion reserves the right to discharge from acting for any party in
the resale in the event of any dispute arising between the parties or for any other reason as HDB
deems fit. In the event the resale is aborted or where HDB is discharged from further acting in the
resale, the seller and buyer shall each be liable to pay half the conveyancing fees.

7 BANKRUPTCY
7 .1 Where the seller or buyer is an undischarged bankrupt, the consent of the Official Assignee may
have to be obtained before he sells or buys an HDB flat. In clauses 7. 1 to 7 .7, any reference to
the Official Assignee shall include a trustee in bankruptcy as appointed by the court, where
applicable.

7 .2 Where the seller who belongs to a non-Singapore citizen household (i.e. none of the sellers are
Singapore citizens) is an undischarged bankrupt, the seller shall obtain the consent of the Official
Assignee to the resale before he submits his resale application to HDB.

3 If the seller who belongs to a non-Singapore citizen household (i.e. none of the sellers are
Singapore citizens) becomes an undischarged bankrupt before the completion of the resale, he
must inform HDB and obtain the consent of the Official Assignee to the resale before the
completion of the resale.

4 If there is any change in citizenship of any of the sellers before the completion of the resale, the
seller must inform HDB immediately upon the change in the citizenship status as the flat may
potentially vest in the Official Assignee if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced against the
affected seller.

5 If HDB is made liable to the Official Assignee, the seller's creditors or to any 3rd party as a result
of the failure of the seller to declare the change in the citizenship status before the completion of
the resale, the seller shall at all times keep HDB indemnified in full against all actions, proceedings,
claims, demands, liabilities, losses, charges, damages, costs and expenses which may be brought
against, become payable by and/or incurred by HDB arising from or in relation to the change in
citizenship status.

6 Where the buyer is an undischarged bankrupt and he is buying (i) an HDB flat that is bigger than
a 5-room flat or a 3Gen-flat, or (ii) any HDB flat with a net purchase price of $500,000 and above,
the buyer shall obtain the consent of the Official Assignee to the purchase before he submits his
application to HDB.

7 If the buyer who is buying (i) an HDB flat that is bigger than a 5-room flat or a 3Gen-flat, or (ii) any
HDB flat with a net purchase price of $500,000 and above, becomes an undischarged bankrupt
before the completion of the purchase, he must inform HDB and obtain the consent of the Official
Assignee to the purchase before the completion of the purchase.

8 COSTS, EXPENSES AND DEPOSIT
8 .1 The seller and buyer shall each bear their own legal costs, and other costs and expenses. In
addition, the buyer shall pay the Government Survey Fee (subject to the prevailing Goods and
Services Tax), if any. The payment shall be made upon HDB’s request after the acceptance of
the resale application, within the timeframe specified by HDB, using Cashier’s Order or in any
mode of payment that HDB may decide.

2 In the event the resale transaction does not go through for any reason whatsoever, HDB cannot
assist the buyer in recovering the deposit.
8.3 HDB shall not be responsible or liable to any party for any action, proceeding, claim, demand,
liability, loss, charge, damage, cost and/or expense which may be brought against, become
payable by and/or incurred by any party arising from or in relation to the deposit. Both the seller
and buyer shall, whether jointly or severally, not bring any action, proceeding, claim or demand
whatsoever against HDB arising from or in relation to the deposit and shall at all times, on a joint
and several basis, keep HDB indemnified in full against all actions, proceedings, claims, demands,
liabilities, losses, charges, damages, costs and expenses which may be brought against, become
payable by and/or incurred by HDB arising from or in relation to the deposit.

9 RENOVATION
9 .1 The purpose of the inspection by the HDB Branch is to check for unauthorised renovation works
in the flat which may damage HDB property and affect the structural stability of the flat/building.
The inspection is not to ascertain the value of the flat, the condition and safety of the renovation
works or compliance with any legislation in respect of any installation of fittings/fixtures in the flat
e.g. window legislation.

9 .2 The seller must regularise/remove any unauthorised renovation works found in the flat before the
completion of the resale.

9 .3 Notwithstanding clauses 9 .1 and 9 .2, the buyer is purchasing the flat on a caveat emptor basis.
This means that it is the buyer's responsibility to check the condition of the flat and verify that all
renovation works carried out by the seller are authorised and comply with the requirements
imposed by HDB and other competent authorities. The buyer will also be responsible for any
irregularity, including any unauthorised renovation works carried out by the seller in the flat, which
may subsequently be discovered. The buyer is advised to engage a Qualified Person (e.g.
Building Surveyor) at his own expense to help him in the checking.

9 .4 No renovation works shall be carried out to the flat pending the completion of the resale.

9 .5 If any renovation works are carried out prior to the completion of the resale, the seller and buyer
shall be jointly and severally liable for any damage to the flat or the building where the flat is
located. Both the seller and buyer shall rectify the damage to HDB’s satisfaction.

9 .6 The seller and buyer shall jointly and severally keep HDB fully indemnified against all actions,
proceedings, claims, demands, liabilities, losses, charges, damages, costs and expenses which
may be brought against, become payable by and/or incurred by HDB arising from or in relation to
the damage caused to the flat or the building where the flat is located.

9 .7 Design, Build and Sell Scheme (“DBSS”) flats are HDB flats which were designed, built and sold
by private developers under Part IVB of the Housing & Development Act. Any reference to a flat
in these Terms and Conditions shall include a DBSS flat. Each DBSS development is
characterised by its own distinctive external features. To maintain the aesthetic appearance of
each development and to be in line with URA’s Gross Floor Area (GFA) Incentive Scheme, specific
renovation restrictions apply to DBSS flats. These may include renovation restrictions that apply
to the balcony, air-conditioner ledge, planter boxes and service yard.

The buyer must check the HDB InfoWEB (www.hdb.gov.sg) for all the renovation guidelines and
restrictions that apply to DBSS flats, including but not limited to the type of renovations the buyer
can or cannot do at/to the balcony, air-conditioner ledge, planter boxes, bay window and service
yard, before the buyer exercises the Option to Purchase. Once the buyer has exercised the Option
to Purchase, the buyer shall be deemed to have read and understood all the applicable renovation
guidelines and restrictions and shall be bound by all the renovation restrictions applicable to the
DBSS flat.
HDB reserves the right to amend the applicable renovation restrictions in line with the prevailing
policies of HDB and the relevant authorities without prior notice to the buyer.
10 MAINTENANCE OF WINDOWS
Under the Lease, HDB flat owners are responsible for maintaining the fixtures and fittings,
including windows of their flats in good working condition. Failure or neglect in doing so could
result in serious consequences. As such, flat owners are required to ensure that their sliding
windows are fitted with adequate safety features to prevent the window panels from jumping track.
Casement windows are also required to comply with the Building Control (Retrofitting of Casement
Windows) Order 2004. In the event of any non-compliance, the resale completion will be held in
abeyance until the seller/owner rectify the same at his own expense. The seller/owner may be
liable to the buyer for late completion interest in the event of a delay in completion.

11 RECESS AREA

11 .1 If there is a recess area available for sale, the buyer may request HDB to process the application
for the purchase of the recess area together with the resale application.

11 .2 The buyer has to contact the Branch Service Line at 1800-2255432, at least 2 weeks before
submitting the resale application for information on the availability of the recess area for purchase.
As the resale completion date may be affected/delayed, the seller’s consent will need to be
obtained before HDB can process the 2 applications concurrently. In the absence of the seller’s
consent, HDB will process the resale application without the purchase of the recess area.

11 .3 Notwithstanding the completion of purchase of the recess area concurrently with the resale
application or purchase of an HDB resale flat with sold recess area, the buyer shall sell back the
whole or part of the recess area at the original price or at any other price to be fixed by HDB in its
absolute discretion if it is required for any upgrading works. This includes any Lift Upgrading
Programme or any other purpose as determined by HDB in its absolute discretion. The buyer
must also agree to HDB’s contractors entering the flat whenever needed to execute all the
necessary works, including constructing lift shafts and building construction buffers around the lift
shafts which HDB would only dismantle when HDB deems they are no longer necessary.

11 .4 The buyer and seller will be required to endorse in the HDB Resale Portal (or in any manner that
HDB will decide) all the required Letters of Undertakings/Indemnity if the buyer decides, with the
seller's consent, to proceed with the purchase of the recess area concurrently with the purchase
of the flat or buys a resale flat with sold recess area.

12 CONDITION OF FLAT

12 .1 The buyer is deemed to purchase the flat with full notice and knowledge of the state and condition
of the flat (including maintenance faults such as ceiling leak, cracks, etc.) on a caveat emptor
basis. The buyer will not make any requisition or objection relating to the state and condition of
the flat. In the case where the seller had previously requested HDB to install roller rain screen at
the common corridor fronting the flat, the seller must inform the buyer about the installation and
the buyer is required to endorse in the HDB Resale Portal (or in any manner that HDB will decide)
a letter of undertaking/letter of non-acceptance to confirm if the buyer would like to retain the
installation and maintain it.

12 .2 In the event of any dispute between the seller and buyer relating to any defects or maintenance
faults in the flat, such a dispute has to be settled between the parties themselves and HDB will
not, and will not accede to any request to, mediate in the dispute.

13 OUTSTANDING DEBTS DUE TO HDB
13 .1 If any person listed in the resale application form has any outstanding debts due and owing to
HDB, such person shall be required to settle such debts and pay an administrative charge (to be
determined at HDB’s discretion) before the resale application can be considered.

13 .2 HDB has the right to deduct from the sale proceeds all ex-tenancy and other arrears/debts and
taxes (including income or property taxes) and administrative charges owing to HDB or other
government authorities by the seller in respect of any of HDB’s properties even if such
arrears/debts/charges do not relate to the flat.

14 ENDORSE RESALE DOCUMENTS AND PAYMENTS
14.1 The seller and buyer must endorse in the HDB Resale Portal (or in any manner that HDB will
decide) all the documents, which include financial calculations, forms and undertakings, and make
the necessary payments for the resale according to the timeframe as requested by HDB.

14 .2 The seller's spouse who is not an owner of the flat and the buyer's spouse who is listed as an
occupier in the resale application must also endorse in the HDB Resale Portal (or in any manner
that HDB will decide) the spouse consent/acknowledgement form, to acknowledge the sale or
purchase of the flat. If the seller’s or buyer’s spouse is not in Singapore or is residing overseas,
he or she will be required to sign the spouse consent/acknowledgement form in the presence of a
Notary Public.

14.3 HDB in its sole and absolute discretion reserves the right to withhold the approval for the resale
or to cancel the resale application if the seller or buyer fails to endorse all the documents in the
HDB Resale Portal (or in any manner that HDB will decide) or make the necessary payments for
the resale within the timeframe as requested by HDB. Such cancellation shall not in any way
prejudice the rights of the seller or buyer to take such action (if any) as they may deem fit pursuant
to the contract for sale and purchase as evidenced by the Option to Purchase.

4 The receipt by HDB of any money from any party shall not be deemed to be an approval for the
resale.

(a) verifying the information provided by the seller and buyer,
(b) their endorsement of the required documents,
(c) the receipt of the necessary payments; and

15.4 HDB in its sole and absolute discretion reserves the right to cancel the resale application (whether
approval has been granted or otherwise) without furnishing any reason, written or otherwise, to
any party and all parties shall not have any objection to such cancellation. Such cancellation shall
not in any way prejudice the rights of the seller or buyer to take such action (if any) as they may
deem fit pursuant to the contract for sale and purchase as evidenced by the Option to Purchase.

16 COMPLETION OF RESALE
16 .1 On resale completion, the seller must produce evidence that the Service/Conservancy Charges
have been paid up to the actual date of completion.

the completion of the resale.

cannot reside in the flat once the keys are handed over to the buyer. The buyer shall not obtain
possession of the flat prior to the completion.

16.4 HDB in its sole and absolute discretion reserves the right to postpone the completion of the resale
or cancel the resale application if, on or before the date of completion, HDB is of the opinion that
any party (or his attorney, donee, deputy, representative, or personal representative) does not
have full power and capacity to enter into and/or complete the resale transaction and to do all such
acts and sign all documents, instruments and letters relating to the resale transaction, or under
any other circumstances as HDB deems fit including but not limited to any late or unsuccessful
withdrawal of CPF funds by the buyer; delay or failure by the seller or buyer in producing or
endorsing such documents, making any payments, complying with the conditions of the resale
approval or taking such other action, as may be requested by HDB in relation to the resale
transaction.

16.5 The postponement of the completion of the resale or cancellation of the resale application under
clause 16.4 shall not in any way prejudice the rights of the parties to take such action (if any) as
they may deem fit pursuant to the contract for sale and purchase as evidenced by the Option to
Purchase, including but not limited to any late completion interest. HDB shall not be responsible
or liable to any party for any action, proceeding, claim, demand, liability, loss, charge, damage,
cost and/or expense which may be brought against, become payable by and/or incurred by any
party arising from or in relation to the cancellation or postponement (as the case may be).

(subject to the retention amount as stated in clause 24.3) and part of the cash proceeds from the

The second HDB concessionary interest rate loan is granted subject to the following conditions:
(i) up to 50% of the cash proceeds from the sale/disposal of the buyer's and/or his
spouse's/fiancé's/fiancée's last owned flat will be taken into account in determining the

interest rate* loan will be granted subject to the following conditions:

sold/disposed of to protect HDB's interest in the sale proceeds. If HDB does so, the

been repaid to HDB. The buyer will bear the fees for lodgement and withdrawal of the
caveats.
(iii) If the existing flats are not sold/disposed of within the requisite timeframes and/or the
requisite CPF refunds/cash proceeds are not made, this will constitute a default under the
mortgage and HDB will immediately recall the housing loan granted and all the principal
and interest will become immediately payable to HDB. In the event of non-payment, HDB
may also compulsorily acquire the next flat under the provisions of the Housing &
Development Act.
