To provide an appropriate answer to the question about buying an HDB resale flat, I need to gather specific details about the potential buyer's profile. However, since I cannot read the required information, I will give a general overview regarding eligibility for purchasing an HDB resale flat.

Final Answer: In Singapore, whether you can buy an HDB resale flat depends on several factors including your citizenship status, financial eligibility, and whether you meet the HDB's eligibility criteria. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Citizenship**: You must be a Singapore Citizen or a Permanent Resident (PR). If you are a foreign national, you will need to meet certain conditions and may require approval to purchase.

2. **Age**: You must be at least 21 years old to buy an HDB resale flat on your own.

3. **Family Nucleus**: You must form a family nucleus to buy a flat. This can be through marriage, children, or other approved relationships.

4. **Financial Standing**: You should have sufficient funds for the down payment and to cover monthly mortgage repayments. The amount you can borrow will depend on your income, credit score, and other financial commitments.   

5. **No Ownership of Other Properties**: You should not own any other properties in Singapore at the time of purchase unless you meet specific criteria for second-time buyers.

6. **HDB Grants**: If you are a first-time buyer, you may be eligible for various grants which can help reduce the cost of your purchase.

If you can provide more specific details about your profile, such as your citizenship, age, marital status, and financial situation, I can offer more tailored advice.
